# Installation

## Windows
NPC Tweak is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.

Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using WinRAR or 7zip. If properly extracted, you should have an **npc_tweak** folder and **setup-npc_tweak.exe** in your BG2 folder. To install, simply double-click **setup-npc_tweak.exe** and follow the instructions on screen.

Please run **setup-npc_tweak.exe** in your BG2 folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

## Mac OS X
If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the new version. NPC Tweak is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your BG2 folder.  If properly extracted, you should have an **npc_tweak** folder, **setup-npc_tweak**, and **setup-npc_tweak.command** in your BG2 folder. To install, simply double-click **setup-npc_tweak.command** and follow the instructions on screen.

## Linux
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from WeiDU.org and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG2 installation directory, run `tolower` and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running `tolower` and choosing both options is the safe bet.
Run `WeInstall npc_tweak` in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing.
